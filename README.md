# JMeter - REST API

In this an [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) template that I usually use to test the performance of my REST APIs.

The main goal of this project is to keep most configurations about endpoints, methods, bodies and responses out of the `.jmx` file; the load test parameters can be configured in the [loadtest.csv]() file and also in the JSON files found in the `input` and `assertion` folders.

## Configuration
